"""Project tests.

Two categories of tests are available:

    spiders - unit test verifying the basic operation of the crawlers and the
    parsers they use to extract data,

    sites - integration tests that download and extract data from third-party
    sites to verify the correct behaviour of the crawlers. These tests are
    also useful to check for changes to the sites that require the crawlers
    to be updated.
